# GraphApp

Our internship project for Python development with Bottle Web Framework. It allows to calculate algorithms on the adjacency matrix for graphs:
- Hamilton Algorithm
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- Floyd Algorithm

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
git clone https://github.com/Computers-Ultimate-Media/BottleWebProject_C921_3_KVP
cd BottleWebProject_C921_3_KVP
py ./app.py
```

## Built With

* [BottlePy](https://bottlepy.org/) - Python Web Framework
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Free and open-source CSS framework
* [Minty theme](https://bootswatch.com/minty/) - Bootstrap theme that we used

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
